# Terms & Condition Reader (a.k.a SummaRizer)

As we know in our day to day life we go through many 
Terms & Condition in which we just blindly go on 
accepting them but they may contain a lot of hidden
information that we aren't aware of at all. For our ease
and to save time we scroll down and accept to it which
can be fatal



## Solution

A simple minimalistic UI based app or website can be formulated which can
act as a Reader and Finder of the most suggested keywords
which will be the target findings in the copied and pasted
Terms & Condition. It will be able to provide a crisp & concise
summary of the entire detailed.

## Optimization

This can be further more optimized and enhanced using
AI & ML which will be trained to detect such conflictory
statements that we agree and accept blindly. We can't 
keep to simple search and find as it won't be much viable
in the longer run.
## Implementation and Deployment

Without any survey it can be said that 99% of the general
population don't read these T&C and just blindly agrees to them.

Hence from a market point of view it can be use to target
the general mass population. It can also help in cases of like 
any agreement from Bank too e.g. Loan Agreement which are filled
with teadious number of papers with tons of statement which we just
blindly trust on the agent and signs them.
